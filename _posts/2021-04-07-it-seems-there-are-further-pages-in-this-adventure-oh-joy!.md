In so many ways it fills me with jo to know that this adventure has not ended prematurely and much like this sentence, it continues to give of itself, choosing not to let go until the moment is right for things to end and time to reset itself, although those times are now past and these words have become immutable proff that this did once happen on a frosty morning in early April during uncertain times of wordly affairs and covid stares. And there it ended just as it was well to do - now we shall leave it there and move on.

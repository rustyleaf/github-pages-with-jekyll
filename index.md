# Eh... what's up?

Although you have taken the time to come all the way here to read this, I am not sure you are going to find it as fulfilling as you might have imagined... but at least you can put your expectations to bed now and begin living closer to reality. This is just a static page of web content used for a tutorial about building a github page. No fancy schmancy sexy fun stuff here I'm afraid!

Well, off you go then and find something a little more expectant of your expectations!

And again, thanks for making the effort to bring yourself here - if nothing else it was some good exercise wasn't it?
